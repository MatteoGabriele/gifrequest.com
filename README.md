## GifRequest

A pointless web game where random repositories get loaded, a GIF is pulled in, and you’re forced to guess which repo it belongs to.  
Click “Merge” to feel powerful. Fail, and you’ll hit a merge conflict.  
Keep going if you want to build a streak, or stop — it doesn’t matter, nothing matters.  

No cookies.  
No tracking.  
No AI.  
Just waste some good time.
